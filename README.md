This is a Spatial Repetition System app.  Make flash cards, and based on how well you know each card, the app will test you on that card right before when you would next forget the card.  The next study date for a card is calculated using the SuperMemo 2 algorithm.  You can find more information about this algorithm here: https://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm

To find the implementation of the scheduling algorithm go to models/scheduler.rb
